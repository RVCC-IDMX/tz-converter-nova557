# tz-converter App

The app tells the time and date in certain places in the world. Whether you would be flying, driving, or on foot the app will clarify. It converts the specific time zone in a specific place. 

To use the app type the place you want in the Default Time Zone (country/city). Then, you can type in the terminal (node index.js) and find the date and time of that place.
