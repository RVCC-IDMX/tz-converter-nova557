# Let's Learn a VS Code Setting

The file that I picked from the VS Code Setting is `"files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true`. When the file is true it removes trailing white spaces from all the coding in VS Code. While being false, it doesn't remove any of the whitespaces. This can be very useful for VS Code as you can see the coding much more clear and organized without any spaces between the wordings. Also, it can make it easier to get all of the coding right and without any errors.

# Let's Learn an ESLint Rule

Another file that I picked from the ESLint Rule is `"ignoreComments": true`. It is a lot similar to what I picked from the VS Code Setting as it removes all un-needed spaces from the codings in the comment blocks. While being false, it doesn't remove it after being saved. It all looks much more clean and neat when the words in the comments aren't so apart.
